# Programs with intrinsically derived cost expressions

StaticComplexity.AlgorithmShape can analyze a finite control-flow tree, but
using it next to an independently written Lean function duplicates the
algorithm: once as executable code and once as a complexity description. This
module removes that duplication for structured algorithms. A
StructuredProgram is executable syntax. Its interpreter supplies the actual
Cost run, while StructuredProgram.analyze traverses the same syntax to derive
its symbolic worst-case resource expression.

Assignment, branching, sequencing, counted iteration, and fuelled while loops
are charged by the interpreter itself. An opaque library or foreign primitive
can enter through external, but must carry a local proof that its instrumented
operation count is bounded by its advertised expression. Thus the analyzer
never infers a cost for an opaque Lean function merely from its name.

This follows the cost-semantics pattern of Danielsson (POPL 2008) and CSLib's
TimeM, while strengthening trusted annotations by linking every external
annotation to a local inequality. The asymptotic endpoint uses Mathlib's
Asymptotics.IsBigO; the executable polynomial checker remains the finite,
sound but intentionally incomplete front end.

/-! ## Typed primitive programs with exact extracted cost

This layer follows the free-monad/query-combinator architecture used by
Algolean.  It is complementary to StructuredProgram below.  PrimitiveProgram
supports arbitrary dependent data flow: the rest of a program may depend on
the result of an instruction.  Its interpreter reads the actually selected
continuation and produces an exact symbolic sum of primitive costs.

Because an input-indexed family may generate a different finite program for
every input, exact extraction alone does not establish one uniform asymptotic
bound.  StructuredProgram supplies compact, uniformly bounded loops for that
second task.
