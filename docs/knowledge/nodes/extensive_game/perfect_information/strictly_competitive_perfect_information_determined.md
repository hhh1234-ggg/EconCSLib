# Strictly Competitive Perfect-Information Determinacy

Every finite strictly competitive game with perfect information is determined.

Equivalently, when terminal outcomes are interpreted as player 1 payoffs and
player 2 has the opposite preference order, the game has a pure-strategy value.

## Proof Sketch

Order outcomes by player 1's preference. Let $R_k$ be the smallest initial segment
of outcomes that player 1 can guarantee. Player 1 can guarantee $R_k$, while by
Zermelo determinacy player 2 can guarantee the complement of $R_{k-1}$. This
identifies the threshold outcome and gives determinacy.
