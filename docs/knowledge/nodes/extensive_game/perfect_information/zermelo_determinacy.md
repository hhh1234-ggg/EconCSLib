# Zermelo Determinacy For Finite Perfect-Information Games

Every simple finite game with perfect information is determined.

## Proof Sketch

The proof is by induction on the length of the tree. Each successor of the origin
defines a shorter subgame. By the induction hypothesis, each such subgame is
determined and has value $+1$ or $-1$ according to which player can force a win.
The player who moves at the origin chooses a successor with the best value; if that
value is favorable, that player wins, otherwise the opponent's winning strategy in
each successor subgame wins.
